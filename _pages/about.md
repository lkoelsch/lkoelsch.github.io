I am Lukas Kölsch and currently a tenure track Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida. I finished my PhD at the University of Rostock in Germany in 2020.

I do math with applications to cryptography and coding theory. Recently, I have been working on semifields, rank-metric codes and non-linear Boolean functions like APN functions. Generally, I like to combine ideas from algebra, combinatorics and number theory to solve specific problems that are related to applications in coding theory or cryptography.
