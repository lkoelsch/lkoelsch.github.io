I am Lukas Kölsch and currently a Math/Crypto Postdoc at the University of South Florida and the Center for Cryptographic Research in Tampa. Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Rostock in Germany.

My work is on the interface between math and cryptography as well as coding theory. Recently, I have been working on semifields, rank-metric codes and non-linear Boolean functions like APN functions. Generally, I like to combine ideas from algebra, combinatorics and number theory to solve specific problems that are related to applications in coding theory or cryptography.

News
======
(08-09-22) Check out my new preprint on [c-differential uniformity of Boolean functions and their relation to differential attacks on block ciphers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03884) (joint work with Daniele Bartoli and Giacomo Micheli)

(07-27-22) Check out my new preprint on [counting the Taniguchi semifields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13497). Here, we give a new best lower bound on the total number of semifields of odd order. (joint work with Faruk Göloglu)

(July 2022) My [paper on a new family of commutative semifields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04923) was accepted for publication in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society! In this paper, we present a new family of commutative semifields and prove that the total number of commutative semfields of order p^n is exponential in n, solving what has been called the "biggest problem in the theory of commutative semifields"! The previous best known bound was quadratic in n. (joint work with Faruk Göloglu)

(07/18/2022-07/22/2022) I co-organized the CodebreakHERS cybersecurity camp for grade 8-12 girls at the University of South Florida. Check out our [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/codebreakhers/) for pictures!


Upcoming Talks and Events
=====
I will be at the Finite Geometries Conference in Irsee, Germany, in August 2022 and also at the Boolean Functions conference in Bergen, Norway, in September 2022. For details, see the [Talks section](https://lkoelsch.github.io/talks/).
